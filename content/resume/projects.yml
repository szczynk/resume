    I started this project as a way of learning <mark>NuxtJS</mark> and <mark>Element</mark> component library.
    I have learned many skills through this and been I’m very proud of having this in my portfolio.
    If you don’t have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
    I also explore the basis of <mark>Travis</mark> to compile this project and publish it on the <mark>Github page</mark>
    Finally, I am not a Web Designer but I would like to understand well the <mark>Dark Theme</mark> provide by Google.
    So this is why I manually modify the <mark>CSS</mark> to follow as many as possible
